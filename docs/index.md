# Kanata

Kanata is an Application Started powered mainly by Slim Framework and OpenSwoole.

With it you have ready a WebApp with an HTTP, WebSocket and AMQP interfaces. Kanata is a minimal sized structure that allows micro applications as well as big and powerful ones. Its architecture is Plugin based and it is independent from an external web server thanks to Swoole.

It comes with a docker-compose ready environment with the 3 interfaces already available. That said, you'll only need to start the communication and assembling necessary parts of your application through a new plugin.
